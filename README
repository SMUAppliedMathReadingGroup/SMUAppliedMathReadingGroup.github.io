Regarding expectations for a discussion leader. You have roughly three
tasks.

OUR WEBPAGE: https://smuappliedmathreadinggroup.github.io

1. Identify a relatively new paper which is of interest to you. 
2. Make preprations to guide a discussion during the time you sign up
   for
3. Send me the paper url and any notes you have so this can be saved

Notes:
Regarding point 1. This is not an easy task. Often faculty are good
people to run these Ideas by however fundamentaly upon graduation this
is a skill we ought to have honed. Anecdotally I selected a paper last
semester that ended up being pretty bad. I found this experience useful.

Regarding point 2. We have seen this in many forms. Slides, whiteboard
work, scrolling through the paper itself.

Regarding point 3. This serves as a deliverable you can include on a
personal website that suggests to an employer that you were engaged in
a research community above and beyond what was required.
